        Over the past few weeks, you&apos;ve learned all about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created some cool projects, and learned some other useful business and soft skills. Now it&apos;s time to put all of that together and create a portfolio that you can be proud of.

        Now it&apos;s time to take your code to the next level. In the following weeks, you&apos;ll learn more about GitHub and git version control, how to use VS Code as a code editor in a more advanced way, and create larger projects using the ReactJS library while keeping accessibility in mind.

        <b>Note:</b> If you have a GitHub student account, I recommend you to use it to get access to the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>. It&apos;s a great way to get access to a lot of useful tools and services for free, e.g. full access to FrontendMasters, Jetbrains Academy, Microsoft Azure and much more.
