      <h1>About This Website</h1>
      <p> This website is for anyone who wants to set foot into tech by becoming a Frontend Developer with strong focus on accessibility and gain insight from a self-taught developer who was in the same position not too long ago.
      </p>
      <h2>Why accessibility?</h2>
      <p>In the next few years there will be a strong demand on accessibility designer, developers and testers, because the law is getting more strict. LinkedIn even added accessibility to their job titles not too long ago.</p>
      <p>Read more about it in my blog post:{'     '}

      <p>I divide the journey into three phases, as I have experienced it myself.</p>

              <span>Get into coding</span>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Especially for <b>beginners</b>, it&apos;s often not easy to not lose track, stay consistent, and know what matters. It&apos;s too easy to get overwhelmed by too much information. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve made a lot of notes along my journey about how I would like to have taken the path as a developer if I were starting over.

              Somewhat more <b>experienced developers</b> often wonder what projects to put on their resume, how to develop ideas, and what it would be like to work on a team or on a real project at a company. I will outline these paths as best I can.

        <p>
          My name is Julia and I&apos;m a self-taught developer who switched careers in my early 30s after studying Musicology and Japanese Studies while working at a Casino.<br />
          After a full year of hard learning I started looking for a job and found one right away.
          That year was not easy, many ups and downs, so much to learn, but I never gave up and all the work finally paid off. <br />
          I learned a lot throughout this year about how to create a good CV, LinkedIn profile, and GitHub profile, how to pimp my portfolio and prepare for interviews in order to get a job.<br />
          But these things needed time. Time I want to spare you by sharing my knowledge with you.
          I&apos;m looking forward to helping you on your journey to becoming a developer.
